# superheros

Just a list of superheros to be used for the greater good.

## Usage

A simple usage example:

    import 'package:superheros/superheros.dart';

    main() {
			superHeros.forEach(print);
    }

## Development

Superheros leverages the [dart_dev](https://github.com/Workiva/dart_dev) package for most of its
tooling needs, including static analysis, code formatting, running tests, collecting coverage,
and serving examples. Check out the dart_dev readme for more information.

#### Testing - `pub run dart_dev test`
